        <p> Cold coffee is a refreshing, creamy, and slightly frothy beverage made by blending coffee with milk, sugar, and ice. It's a perfect drink for coffee lovers who enjoy a chilled and mildly sweet caffeine boost. Unlike traditional hot coffee, cold coffee is smooth, rich, and often topped with ice cream or chocolate syrup for extra indulgence.</p>
        <p> It's popular in cafes and homes, especially during summer, as it provides the perfect balance of energy and refreshment. Some variations include Mocha Cold Coffee (with chocolate), Caramel Cold Coffee, and Frappe (blended with ice for a thicker texture).</p>
